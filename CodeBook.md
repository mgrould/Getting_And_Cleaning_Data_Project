## Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set

## Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

## Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

## Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names

## Create a second independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
